# MDXCMS

MDXCMS is a dead-simple CMS that allows you to author MDX documents and serve them on your site. 

This project's opinion is that we will not always be the right solution in the future, technology changes rapidly. Therefore, we will not attempt to lock in your data or construct a proprietary API with it. 

## Features

- ‚¨á MDX all the way down! You can edit documents with a WISYWIG mdx editor or just raw MDX.
- üîìno lock in. Choose a Github Pages or hosted backend. Always export all your documents. They are just markdown!
- üí¥Free if you choose to use Github Pages as your backend! We'll charge a small fee to host the files otherwise.

## Use cases

- ‚úíÔ∏è Blogging! The main use case we envision for MDXCMS will be to have a distraction free environment for authoring blog posts with markdown. 
- üìÉ Documentation Sites. Use custom MDX components to do things like render code snippets or live examples.

## Ambitions

This project is NOT ambitious. It aims to do something simple very very well. Please understand that for those reasons we will not implement "Nice to have" features all the time as they are suggested. 

We have seen a lot of developer blogs that check in markdown files to the main site repository. This increases the barrier to generating new content, and slower than ideal deploys of minor changes. We want encourage a new paradigm where the content is stored in a separate repository and then the site can worry about how to render those markdown files.
